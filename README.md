Repository for data associated with Inman et al. 2023 manuscript submission: "Behavioral and Cognitive Consequences of Sexual Conflict: A Comparison of Four Poeciliid Fish Species". This study investigated the role of sexual conflict in shaping female behavioral and cognitive traits as well as cognitive-behavioral syndromes across species.  All sheets are contained within the "data" folder. The code can be found in the main repository. Authors: Callen Inman (UT Austin), Alan Vuong (UT Austin), Ingo Schlupp (U of Oklahoma), and Molly Cummings (UT Austin). Callen Inman and Alan Vuong were responsible for collecting the data presented here, and Callen Inman was responsible for carrying out the analysis. 

The data sheet "RL_errors_across_trials" can be used to generate and analyze spatial learning performance across species (shown in Figure 3F).

The data sheet "matingsystem_mastersheet" contains all of the data relevant for analyzing male-female interactions across species (shown in Figure 2).

The data sheet "Behavior_cognition_master" contains all of the data necessary for univariate species comparisons (Figure 3, besides panel 3F) as well as the multivariate LDA and SEM.

The R script file included in the main repository includes code for all analyses (but not figures) presented in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5. The SEM component is the only one that does not include every analysis performed due to the number of models created for each species. Instead, (using a single-model, single-species example) the methods applied to each species and each model are shown and and annotated. It is presented in the following order: 1. Behavioral and cognitive traits (Figure 3), 2. Mating system analysis (Figure 2), 3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (Figure 4), and Structural Equation Modeling (Figure 5).
